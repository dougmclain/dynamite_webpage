                    <p class="section-text mb-4">
                        Our vision, to offer condominium and homeowner associations a service dedicated 
                        to fraud detection and elimination. Our years of practice has provided far too many examples 
                        of poor behavior and outright actions which were detrimental to associations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-text mb-4">
                        Our vision is simple: money can be protected. It requires constant vigilance, a dedication to perfection, 
                        and a willingness to re-evaluate processes to find new ways to safeguard association money. 
                        We believe our system can deliver this successfully and at a scale which can't be matched by 
                        any management company with its own internal accounting department.

                                    Dynamite Management, LLC began as a CPA firm specializing in Association Audits and Reviews. Over the years we realized that the HOA industry was lacking the expertise needed in the most important aspect of HOA management, Finances and Accounting!

                                    As auditors we heard every excuse in the book from managers as to why they couldn't produce an accurate financial statement. The excuses ranged from we are not "accountants" or "our system can't do that", to "the auditor will fix that during the audit".

                                    Why should your association not have accurate financials all the time, why wait for the auditor to fix the financials in another year or so?

While most management companies will charge a premium for most support services, and will bill you for the entire year whether you used the support or not, we believe in providing services based on what the Association actually needs and uses.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Do you only want support at the owners annual meeting, or do you want support for all board meetings? Does your Association need assistance mailing out meeting packets to all the members? Your association is in control of the amount of support that is needed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    How confident are we that you will love our process? So confident that we have the industry best guarantee, if our services don't work for your association you can cancel our service at anytime, without prior notice or a termination fee. Check your current management contract, there is probably a lengthy termination notice and a pricey termination fee.
                                </p>
